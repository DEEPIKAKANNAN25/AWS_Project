🌐 AWS S3 Static Website Hosting – Personal Portfolio

🧭 Overview

In this project, I hosted my static personal portfolio website using Amazon S3. It walks through the complete process—from creating an S3 bucket to configuring public access and enabling static website hosting. This is a beginner-friendly example of deploying a serverless website on AWS.

☁️ What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable and durable object storage service provided by AWS. It allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web, making it ideal for hosting static websites.

🔹 Key Features of S3

 • Unlimited data storage

 • 99.999999999% durability

• Fine-grained access control

 • Pay-as-you-go pricing model

Seamless integration with AWS services like CloudFront, Lambda, and QuickSight

🎯 Project Objective

 • The goal was to deploy a static portfolio website using Amazon S3 with the following outcomes:

 • Enable public access for global visibility

 • Achieve scalable and reliable hosting without managing servers

 • Provide a clear, step-by-step AWS implementation suitable for beginners

🛠️ AWS Services Used

Amazon S3

IAM (for bucket policy)

🧩 Step-by-Step Implementation

The entire implementation process has been divided into five structured parts to ensure clarity and a smooth workflow.
Each part focuses on a key stage of the project — from creating the S3 bucket to verifying the final hosted website.
Screenshots are provided for every step to visually demonstrate the actions performed in the AWS Management Console.

Part 1: S3 Bucket Creation

Part 2: Bucket Policy Configuration

Part 3: Static Website Hosting Setup

Part 4: File Upload and Management

Part 5: Website Preview and Verification

This division makes it easier to follow the process sequentially and understand the purpose of each configuration made in AWS S3.


🪣 Part 1 – S3 Bucket Creation (Screenshots 1–7)

🖼️ 1. Bucket Name Setup (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/1-bucket-name.png)

            Description:This step shows the creation of a new S3 bucket. You must enter a globally unique bucket name (e.g., my-portfolio-bucket-demo).

             Key Setting:Choose the AWS Region close to your target audience to minimize latency.

🖼️ 2. Object Ownership Configuration (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/2-object-ownership.png)

             Description:Configure who owns and manages uploaded objects in the bucket.

             Best Practice:Select Bucket owner enforced to ensure the bucket owner controls all objects (helps with access consistency).

🖼️ 3. Block Public Access Settings (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/3-block-public-access.png)

             Description:AWS blocks public access by default for security.

             Action:Uncheck Block all public access if your goal is to host a public website.

             Warning:Only disable this if you understand the implications — this bucket will be readable by the public.

🖼️ 4. Versioning Configuration (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/4-versioning-settings.png)

             Description:Versioning helps you keep multiple versions of an object (useful for rollback).

             Optional:Enable versioning for production environments; it’s not mandatory for static websites.

🖼️ 5. Encryption Type Selection (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/5-encryption-type.png)

              Description:You can choose to encrypt your data at rest using Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).

               Best Practice:Use SSE-S3 for simplicity unless compliance requires KMS.

🖼️ 6. Create Bucket Confirmation (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/6-create-bucket.png)

             Description:This screenshot confirms clicking the Create bucket button at the bottom of the page.

             Description:AWS confirms that your bucket has been created.

             Next Step:Click the bucket name to open it and configure it for website hosting.

🔐 Part 2 – Bucket Policy Configuration (Screenshots 8–9)

🖼️ 8. Add Policy JSON Document (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/8-policy-json-document.png)

          Description:In the Permissions tab, add a Bucket Policy that grants public read access to objects.

          Example Policy:

<img width="891" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a90227e-b5d7-431d-acd0-e97ed40b8ed3" />



         Purpose:This allows anyone on the internet to access the files hosted in your S3 bucket.

🖼️ 9. Policy Applied Successfully (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/9-policy-success-message.png)

         Description:This screenshot confirms that the JSON policy was accepted and applied.

         Verification:The bucket should now allow public access to its objects (useful for hosting a static website).

🌐 Part 3 – Static Website Hosting Setup (Screenshots 10–13)

🖼️ 10. Enable Static Website Hosting (https://github.com/DEEPIKAKANNAN25/AWS_Project/blob/main/images/10-static-website-hosting.png)
